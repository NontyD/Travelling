## Validation

Code Institute Python Linter - https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/# was used.
All code validated and where lines were showing as too long they were adjusted. Some line adjustments caused bugs in the code but those bugs were fixed and some codes were rewritten.

## Deployment

### Heroku

The Application has been deployed from GitHub to Heroku by following the steps:

1. Create or log in to your account at heroku.com
2. Create a new app, add a unique app name ( for this project, the name is travellingplanner) and then choose your region
3. Click on create app
4. Go to "Settings"
5. Under Config Vars add the private API key information using key 'CRED' and into the value area copy the API key information added to the .json file.  Also add a key 'PORT' and value '8000'.
6. Add required buildpacks (further dependencies). For this project, set it up so Python will be on top and Node.js on bottom
7. Go to "Deploy" and select "GitHub" in "Deployment method"
8. To connect Heroku app to your Github repository code enter your repository name, click 'Search' and then 'Connect' when it shows below.
9.  Choose the branch you want to build your app from

## Bugs

Throughout the development process, various bugs were identified and resolved iteratively. A notable challenge was ensuring that the code conformed to a strict 79-character line limit, which occasionally introduced unintended errors, such as syntax issues and incorrect line breaks that affected the functionality.

These bugs were carefully managed and fixed as they arose, with particular attention given to maintaining readability and functionality within the character constraints. This iterative debugging process helped enhance both the code’s structure and its adherence to best practices, ensuring a clean and functional final product.
